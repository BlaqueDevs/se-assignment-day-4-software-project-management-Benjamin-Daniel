Strategies to cost control include careful budgeting, tracking expenses, and adjusting scope when needed.

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development, whereas, waterfall is Linear and sequential approach.
Advantages of Agile include:
    Quick response to changes.
    Regular customer feedback.
    There is improved team collaboration.
    
Advantages of Waterfall:
    Clear structure and documentation.
    Easy to manage due to its rigidity.
    
Disadvantages of Agile:
    It is less predictability. 
    It requires significant customer involvement.
    
Disadvantages of Waterfall:
    It is difficult to accommodate changes. 
    Testing occurs late in the process.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is best when it comes to dynamic projects such as app development. 
Waterfall on the other hand works for projects with fixed requirements. For example, infrastructure projects.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
The methods used include regular testing, code reviews, and continuous integration. 
It is important to maintain high standards of the project as it prevent bugs and ensures user satisfaction.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Defining scope sets clear goals. 
WBS breaks down tasks. This makes planning easier and ensures all project aspects are covered.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
Developing a detailed schedule improves planning and resource allocation. 
Gantt charts assists in visualizing the timelines and task dependencies.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
The issues depend on the software being developed, such as efficiency or usability. 
These problems are significant to the audience because they impact user productivity.

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
Clear problem definitions focus development efforts on solving the right issue, leading to better-targeted solutions.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
I can use a sentence like the below one to describe a solution.
"A software that helps you keep track of your expenses with ease."

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
Features such as regular updates, automated services and user friendly make the software stand out.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
Market data for the software includes industry reports, user surveys, and growth projections based on trends and user needs.

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding market trends guide feature prioritization and help position the software to meet current demands, hence improving market fit.
